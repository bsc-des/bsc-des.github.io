Jasmine graduated from the program, in Ceramics & Glass.
Jasmine created a small experiment with generative models in deep learning.
She used the Twemoji dataset, as well as a set of 1200 galaxy images from the web.
Testing weather a computer can generate new emojis or new galaxies, after seeing a lot of them.
You can find more information on her project and on many others in her [website](http://www.jasrub.com).
