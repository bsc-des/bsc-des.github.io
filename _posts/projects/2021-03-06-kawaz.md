Inspired by the Japanese joint ‘K​ awai Tsugite​’, Raz designed the ​Kawaz universal building block - and implemented an algorithm that generates assembly instructions for any object using the minimal number of its instances. To solve the construction problem Raz conceived and implemented an admissible heuristic for the ​A* search algorithm over the Kawaz construction space, which proved to find optimal solutions faster than the classic Dijkstra’s algorithm by orders of magnitude.
